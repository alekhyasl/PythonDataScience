Multi Threading and Multi Processing

Program -> sequence of instructions written in programming language(Ex :Python , c++)
Ex: Google chrome is an .exe file, this is a program which includes how the browser should work
Word, excel are some other examples

Process -> A process is simply an instance of program that is being executed
If i double click the google chrome process will get started

Code segment -> 
Data Segment -> has list of all global and static variables
Heap Memory -> 
stack -> acess to all local variables and function calls
Register -> it is a temporary memory where we can store values for short time

Each browser instance have seperate memory space, so one process cannot corrupt another process
