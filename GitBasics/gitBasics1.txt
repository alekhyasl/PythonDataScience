git -> open source distributed version control system
create github account
create repository (PythonLearnings)
Download git for windows
Install it
to check if git is installed open command prompt and type 'git --version'
installed git version should be displayed

Go to command line and navigate to the folder in command line
say in my case I have to navigate to C:\Users\alekh\Documents\UdemyLearnings\PythonDSA
cd C:\Users\alekh\Documents\UdemyLearnings\PythonDSA
use the command git init
git init -> initializes git repository

Now you have to setup the configuration i.e username and email
in order to know that who commited the code 
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@yourdomain.com"
first check if they are already configured or not in command prompt using
git config --global user.name
git config --global user.email
use command echo "# PythonLearnings" >> README.md in command prompt to create README files
git status -> will let you know about untracked files and commits
untracked files means these files are not yet tracked by git
when the command "git add README.md" is used this file is now tracked by 
git but is not committed to git and is unstaged
When the files need to be pushed to repository we will send 
them to staging environment initially and then pushed
when i use command git commit -m "This is my first commit" all the files are in 
staging environment
git branch -> shows the name of branch to which code is pushed
git branch -M main -> is used to change banch to main
now check by using git branch if branch is changed to main
to make sure our local repository is connect to github repository we use
git remote add origin https://github.com/alekhyamogalapu/PythonLearnings.git
git remote -v -> here we can see from where the file is fetching and where it is getting pushed
git add . -> to make sure all the files are need to be sent to git
To check which remote repository your local folder is connected to we use
git remote -v
If it is connect to different repository
git remote remove origin
use git remote add origin <new-repository-URL>


to clone existin repository to your local
cd path(where the repository should be cloned)
git clone https://github.com/alekhyasl/PythonDataScience.git
git restore --staged "example.txt" -> to unstage the staged files
git reset "example.txt" -> this also retores the mentioned file
